Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity is a set of two interconnected theories: Special Relativity and General Relativity. These theories describe the way the universe 
works at a fundamental level, particularly in terms of how space, time, and gravity behave.

Special Relativity
Special Relativity is based on two postulates:

The laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, regardless of their relative motion.
The speed of light is constant for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.
From these postulates, Einstein was able to derive several counterintuitive but scientifically proven conclusions:

Time dilation: Time appears to move slower for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.
Length contraction: Objects appear shorter in the direction of motion.
Mass-energy equivalence: Energy and mass are interchangeable through Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ², where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.
General Relativity
General Relativity expands on the principles of Special Relativity by including the effects of gravity. According to General Relativity:

Gravity is not a force, but a curvature of space-time caused by the presence of mass and energy.
Objects in free-fall follow the straightest possible path through space-time, which is curved by the presence of massive objects.
The curvature of space-time affects the passage of time, causing time to move slower near massive objects.
These ideas have been confirmed through a variety of experiments, observations, and technological applications. For example, GPS satellites have to correct for both the 
time dilation and the curvature of space-time in order to maintain their accuracy.

In summary, Einstein's Theory of Relativity explains how the universe behaves at a fundamental level. It describes how time, space, and gravity interact and how they 
affect the behavior of objects and energy.
