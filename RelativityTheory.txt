Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity is a set of two interconnected theories: Special Relativity and General Relativity. These theories describe the way the universe 
works at a fundamental level, particularly in terms of how space, time, and gravity behave.

Special Relativity
Special Relativity is based on two postulates:

The laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, regardless of their relative motion.
The speed of light is constant for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.
From these postulates, Einstein was able to derive several counterintuitive but scientifically proven conclusions:

Time dilation: Time appears to move slower for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.
Length contraction: Objects appear shorter in the direction of motion.
Mass-energy equivalence: Energy and mass are interchangeable through Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ², where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.
General Relativity
General Relativity expands on the principles of Special Relativity by including the effects of gravity. According to General Relativity:

Gravity is not a force, but a curvature of space-time caused by the presence of mass and energy.
Objects in free-fall follow the straightest possible path through space-time, which is curved by the presence of massive objects.
The curvature of space-time affects the passage of time, causing time to move slower near massive objects.
These ideas have been confirmed through a variety of experiments, observations, and technological applications. For example, GPS satellites have to correct for both
the time dilation and the curvature of space-time in order to maintain their accuracy.

In summary, Einstein's Theory of Relativity explains how the universe behaves at a fundamental level. It describes how time, space, and gravity interact and how they 
affect the behavior of objects and energy.

Sure, I'll try to simplify it even further!

Einstein's Theory of Relativity is a set of ideas that describe how the universe works at a very basic level. There are two parts to the theory:

Special Relativity: This part says that the laws of physics are the same for everyone, no matter how fast they're moving. It also says that the speed of light is
always the same, no matter how fast you're moving. This leads to some weird things, like time seeming to go slower for people who are moving very fast.

General Relativity: This part says that gravity is not a force that pulls things together, but is instead caused by the curvature of space and time. Basically, objects
with mass cause a distortion in the fabric of space and time, and this distortion is what we perceive as gravity.

These ideas have been proven through experiments and observations, and they help us understand things like why time seems to go slower in stronger gravitational
fields, or why the orbits of planets look the way they do.
