Hi Syed Nasif Ali:

As we discussed, our focus is to actively support employees who need to improve their performance and to work closely with them to develop a plan to actively monitor 
progress. As a result, you are being placed on a performance watch because your performance must improve. The Performance Watch Period will be from [April 24, 2023, to 
May 31, 2023]. We will meet weekly to understand progress in meeting these expectations. I will monitor your results relative to the expectations as outlined below.
 
The following are the specific areas you need to demonstrate improvement on during this period:

Start looking for interested and eligible roles on IBM Marketplace, document and proactively report progress to coach daily.

As discussed, upskill as soon as possible on AWS Certifications (Devops or System admin) and improve more on existing react front end skillset to get off the bench.

Join bench club to get trained on required skills such as resume making, interview facing skills etc.

Attend bench club meetings and assist on bench projects.

Proactively ask for timely assistance if stuck at any point of time during projects and help others if required, solicit feedback from bench club leaders on projects to 
demonstrate identifying and removing barriers collaboratively.

Most importantly, start taking initiative or ownership on all the tasks that has been assigned, again soliciting feedback from account interviews or bench projects to 
demonstrate.

Simultaneously complete required learning 40 hours, earn two digital credentials and achieve cloud certifications on AWS as mentioned above.

Please add these goals to Checkpoint. We will use this to monitor your progress.

This Performance Watch will continue until <May 31, 2023>, at which point we will re-evaluate your progress and next steps.

Should you have any questions, please let me know
