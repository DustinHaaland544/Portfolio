Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain, specifically the neural networks that make up the brain. 
It involves training artificial neural networks on a large dataset, allowing the network to learn and make intelligent decisions on its own.

Deep learning algorithms use multiple layers of artificial neural networks to learn and make decisions. Each layer processes the input data and passes it on to the next 
layer, until the final layer produces the output. The layers in between the input and output layers are called hidden layers, and the process of training a deep learning 
model involves adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between the neurons in these hidden layers.

One of the key benefits of deep learning is its ability to learn from unstructured and unlabeled data, such as images, audio, and text. This is in contrast to traditional
machine learning algorithms, which typically require the data to be manually labeled and structured in a specific way.

Deep learning has been successful in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and even playing games like chess 
and Go. It has also been used to make significant progress in fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.
