GitHub provides free web hosting for front-end web apps through a service called GitHub Pages. It’s especially useful for hosting static websites, which include HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript (like your front-end apps). Here’s how it works:

How to Host a Web App with GitHub Pages

1. Choose or Create a Repository

- You can use an existing repo that contains your front-end code.

- Make sure your app’s entry point is an index.html file.

2. Push Your Code to the main or master Branch

3. Enable GitHub Pages

- Go to your repository on GitHub.

- Click Settings > Pages (usually in the left sidebar).

- Under "Source", select the branch (main or master) and optionally a folder (usually /root or /docs).

- Click Save.

https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/

For Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React

If you’re using React (e.g., Create React App), add this to your package.json:

"homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name"

Then run:

npm run build

And push the contents of the build/ folder to a new gh-pages branch, or use the gh-pages package:

npm install --save gh-pages

In package.json scripts:

"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}

Then deploy using:

npm run deploy

Bonus: Custom Domain

You can also use a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a CNAME file and updating your DNS.
