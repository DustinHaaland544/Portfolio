There are several ways to sell your designs as part of a dropshipping business:

Online marketplaces: Websites like Amazon, Etsy, and Redbubble allow you to create your own store and list your designs for sale on various products such as t-shirts and
posters. These marketplaces handle the payment processing and shipping on your behalf.

Print-on-demand platforms: Companies like Printful, Teelaunch, and Printify provide a way for you to create your own online store and use their printing and shipping
services to fulfill orders for your designs on t-shirts and posters.

Social media: You can use platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest to promote your designs and direct customers to your online store or marketplace listings.

Influencer Marketing: Partner with influencers in your niche and ask them to promote your products on their social media platforms. This can help drive more traffic to
your store and increase sales.

Online ads: You can run online ads on platforms like Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, and Instagram Ads to promote your designs and drive traffic to your store.

Email Marketing: Build an email list of potential customers and send them promotions, new designs and other updates.

Note that dropshipping is a highly competitive field, you will have to find a way to standout and make your designs unique and appealing to your target audience.
