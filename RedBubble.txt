Opening a store and selling print-on-demand designs on items at Redbubble is a relatively simple process. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to get started:

Sign up for a Redbubble account: Go to the Redbubble website and create an account. You'll need to provide some basic information, such as your email address and a 
password.

Create your product designs: Use a graphic design software such as Adobe Illustrator or Canva to create your designs for t-shirts, posters, and other products. Make sure 
your designs are high-quality and visually appealing.

Add your designs to your store: Once you have your designs ready, log in to your Redbubble account and navigate to the "Upload designs" section. Here you can upload your 
designs and select the products you want them to be printed on.

Set up your store: Once your designs are uploaded, you can set up your store by adding a profile picture, bio and other details. You can also customize your store's 
appearance by choosing a theme and editing the layout.

Promote your store: Once your store is set up and your products are listed, it's time to start promoting your store. You can use various marketing channels such as social
media, online ads, influencer marketing and email marketing to drive traffic to your store.

Fulfill and track orders: Redbubble will handle the printing and shipping of your products once an order is placed. You will receive notification for each order, and you 
can also track your orders and monitor the progress of each one via your Redbubble account.

Get Paid: Redbubble pays out to their sellers on the 1st and 15th of each month, as long as you have a minimum balance of $20. You can choose to be paid by PayPal or 
direct deposit.

Keep in mind that Redbubble is a highly competitive marketplace, so it's important to make your designs stand out and appeal to your target audience. Additionally, it's 
also important to ensure that your store and products are well presented and easy to navigate. Consistently adding new designs and promoting your store will help you grow
your sales on Redbubble.
