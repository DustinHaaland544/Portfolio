Apologies for the oversight. To apply the filter to existing emails from a specific sender and skip the inbox, please follow these steps:

In Gmail, perform a search for emails from the desired sender by entering the email address or name in the search bar at the top and pressing Enter.

Gmail will display the search results with emails from the specified sender.

Select the emails you want to apply the filter to by clicking the checkboxes next to each email or using the select-all checkbox at the top left corner to select all 
emails on the current page.

Once you have selected the emails, click on the "More" button (three vertical dots) located above the email list.

In the dropdown menu, choose "Filter messages like these."

Gmail will open the filter creation window with the sender's email address or name pre-filled in the "From" field.

Review and modify the filter settings if necessary, such as applying a label or other actions.

Check the box next to "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)" option.

Ensure the box next to "Also apply filter to matching conversations" is checked.

Click on the "Create filter" button to save the filter.

By checking the "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)" option, Gmail will apply the filter to the selected emails, move them out of the inbox, and archive them directly. 
Subsequently, any new emails from the sender will also be filtered and skip the inbox according to the settings you have configured.
