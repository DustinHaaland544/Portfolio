Line 2 and 5 did not work at my personal pc maybe because it has discord integrated in lot of apps. So removing them completely was not possible. When you buy a new
laptop, do not install discord at all and try line 2 and 5. 

Found a way:

1. Open Chrome in incognito mode [Ctrl + Shift + N].
2. Go to "midjourney.com".
3. Click "Join the Beta" button.
4. At the new window that opened set an username.
5. Click "Join"
6. Select the images asked in the Capthcha. 
7. Set your Date of Birth
8. Open "https://smailpro.com/advanced" link in a new incognito window.
9. Refresh the window. 
10. Click on the dropdown of the field.
11. Select an email username.
12. Click create. 
13. Click on the email generated below the field to copy it. 
14. Paste the email at the discord window. 
15. Set a password.
16. Click "Claim Account". 
17. Go back to the smailpro page
18. Click on the Refresh button below the field to receive the email.
19. Click on the email.
20. Click on the "Verify" button in the email. 
21. Go back to the Discord page.
22. Refresh the Window. 
23. Click on one of the newbie channels on the left-side bar
24. On the field below generate any image by typing "/imagine"
25. Enter whatever image you want to generate. 
26. Press Enter
27. Click on "Accept Tos" red button.
28. On the field below generate any image by typing "/imagine" again. 
29. Enter whatever image you want to generate again.
30. Press Enter again. 
31. Enjoy
