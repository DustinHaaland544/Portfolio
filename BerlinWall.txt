As the sun rose over the city of Berlin, Anna and Max stood at the edge of their neighborhood, gazing at the construction of the Berlin Wall in the distance. 
Tears streamed down Anna's face as she clutched Max's hand tightly, unable to believe that they were being forced to say goodbye.

For years, Anna and Max had been inseparable, their love growing stronger with each passing day. They had met as children in the streets of East Berlin, and as they 
grew older, they knew that they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.

But with the construction of the Berlin Wall, their dreams of a future together were shattered. Anna was from the East, and Max was from the West, and the wall meant 
that they could no longer see each other.

"I'll never forget you," Max said, his voice choked with emotion. "I'll always love you, no matter what."

Anna nodded, unable to speak through her sobs. She knew that this was the end, that she would never see Max again. But she also knew that her love for him would never 
die, and that she would always hold on to the memories of their time together.

As the sun set on their final day together, Anna and Max shared one last kiss, their lips pressed together in a passionate embrace. And then, with heavy hearts, they 
turned and walked away from each other, each heading to their own side of the Berlin Wall, knowing that their love would always be a part of them, no matter how far 
apart they were.
