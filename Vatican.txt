There is a popular conspiracy theory that suggests that the Vatican is hiding various secrets and artifacts underneath St. Peter's Basilica, including the Holy Grail and 
the Ark of the Covenant. However, there is no evidence to support these claims and they are generally considered to be baseless.

It is true that there are underground levels and tombs beneath St. Peter's Basilica, as is common in many churches and cathedrals. These include the Vatican Necropolis, 
which is an underground cemetery that contains the tombs of several popes and other important figures. The Necropolis has been the subject of much historical and 
archaeological research and has been open to the public for tours since the early 20th century.

However, there is no credible evidence to suggest that the Vatican is hiding any secrets or artifacts beneath St. Peter's Basilica. These conspiracy theories are not 
supported by facts and are often perpetuated by those seeking to sensationalize the history and activities of the Catholic Church.

The underground levels and tombs beneath St. Peter's Basilica are not hidden from the public. In fact, many of these areas are open to the public and can be visited on 
guided tours. For example, the Vatican Necropolis, an underground cemetery that contains the tombs of several popes and other important figures, has been open to the 
public for tours since the early 20th century.

It is true that some areas of the underground levels beneath St. Peter's Basilica are not open to the public. This is not because the Vatican is hiding anything, but 
rather because these areas are used for various operational purposes or are considered to be of a more private nature. For example, some areas are used as storage or 
maintenance areas, while others are used as chapels or places of worship for the clergy.
