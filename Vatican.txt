There is a popular conspiracy theory that suggests that the Vatican is hiding various secrets and artifacts underneath St. Peter's Basilica, including the Holy Grail and 
the Ark of the Covenant. However, there is no evidence to support these claims and they are generally considered to be baseless.

It is true that there are underground levels and tombs beneath St. Peter's Basilica, as is common in many churches and cathedrals. These include the Vatican Necropolis, 
which is an underground cemetery that contains the tombs of several popes and other important figures. The Necropolis has been the subject of much historical and 
archaeological research and has been open to the public for tours since the early 20th century.

However, there is no credible evidence to suggest that the Vatican is hiding any secrets or artifacts beneath St. Peter's Basilica. These conspiracy theories are not 
supported by facts and are often perpetuated by those seeking to sensationalize the history and activities of the Catholic Church.
