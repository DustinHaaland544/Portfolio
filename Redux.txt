What is Redux?

Redux is a state management library that helps you manage and control the state of your entire application in one place. It makes it easier to:

- Share state between different components.
- Manage complex state logic in large applications.
- Debug issues easily using Redux DevTools.

Redux follows the Flux architecture and is based on the concept of a single source of truth, meaning all your app's state is stored in a global store.

How Does Redux Work?

Redux revolves around three main principles:

1. Single Source of Truth
- The entire application state is stored in a single store.

2. State is Read-Only
- You cannot directly modify the state. Instead, you use actions to request changes.

3. Changes are Made Using Pure Functions (Reducers)
- A reducer is a function that takes the current state and an action and returns a new state.

How Redux Connects with React

Normally, React manages state internally using useState or useContext, but in large applications, managing state can become complex. 
This is where Redux comes in.

With Redux, React components do not manage state themselves. Instead:

- The state is stored globally in the Redux store.
- Components access the store to read data.
- Components dispatch actions to modify the store.

Redux Key Concepts (with Examples):

Now, let’s go step by step with practical examples to understand each concept.

Step 1: Install Redux and React-Redux

To use Redux in your React project, install the required packages:

npm install redux react-redux

Step 2: Create a Redux Store

The store holds the global state of the application.

store.js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import counterReducer from './counterReducer';

const store = createStore(counterReducer);

export default store;

- Here, we create a Redux store using createStore().

- The counterReducer is responsible for handling state updates.

Step 3: Define Actions

Actions describe what should happen (e.g., "increment counter", "decrement counter").

actions.js
export const increment = () => {
    return { type: "INCREMENT" };
};

export const decrement = () => {
    return { type: "DECREMENT" };
};

- Each action is just a function that returns an object with a type.

Step 4: Create a Reducer

A reducer updates the state based on the action type.

counterReducer.js
const initialState = { count: 0 };

const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case "INCREMENT":
            return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case "DECREMENT":
            return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
};

export default counterReducer;

- The reducer receives the current state and an action, then returns a new state.

Step 5: Provide the Redux Store to React
Use the Provider component to make Redux available to all components.

index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./store";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);

- This wraps the React app with the Provider, giving all components access to Redux.

Step 6: Connect Redux to a React Component

Now, let's create a Counter component that:

- Reads state from Redux.
- Dispatches actions to modify state.

Counter.js
import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { increment, decrement } from "./actions";

const Counter = () => {
    const count = useSelector((state) => state.count);  // Get state from Redux
    const dispatch = useDispatch();  // Get dispatch function

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Counter: {count}</h2>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>+</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>-</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Counter;

- useSelector() gets the current count value from Redux.
- useDispatch() allows us to dispatch actions (increment and decrement).

Step 7: Use the Counter Component
Finally, use the Counter component inside App.js.

App.js
import React from "react";
import Counter from "./Counter";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Redux Counter App</h1>
            <Counter />
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;

- Now, clicking the "+" or "-" button updates the state, and Redux handles everything globally!

Summary of Redux Flow in React

1. Store – Holds the global state.

2. Actions – Describe what should happen.

3. Reducer – Updates the state based on actions.

4. Provider – Makes Redux available in React.

5. useSelector – Fetches state in components.

6. useDispatch – Dispatches actions to update state.

Extra: Using Redux Toolkit (Modern Redux)
Redux Toolkit (@reduxjs/toolkit) simplifies Redux setup by reducing boilerplate.

Install Redux Toolkit:

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

A Redux Toolkit counter slice:

import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'counter',
    initialState: { count: 0 },
    reducers: {
        increment: (state) => { state.count += 1; },
        decrement: (state) => { state.count -= 1; },
    }
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;

Replace counterReducer.js with this file, and Redux becomes much cleaner!
