Redux Thunk is a middleware for the Redux library that allows you to write asynchronous logic in a Redux application. To understand what Redux Thunk does and why 
it's useful, let's break it down in simple terms.

1. Understanding Redux Actions:

In Redux, you manage the state of your application using a central store, and you update this state using actions. Actions are plain JavaScript objects that 
describe something that has happened in your application. For example, when a user clicks a button, you can create an action called "BUTTON_CLICK," which 
describes that event.

2. Synchronous Actions:

Most actions in Redux are synchronous, which means they immediately change the state of your application. For instance, when a user clicks a button, a synchronous 
action updates the state, and you see the change right away.

3. Asynchronous Actions:

However, some actions involve asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an API, reading a file, or waiting for a timer. These actions cannot immediately 
change the state because they take time to complete. If you dispatch a regular (synchronous) action for an asynchronous operation, it would execute immediately 
and wouldn't wait for the async operation to finish.

4. The Need for Redux Thunk:

This is where Redux Thunk comes in. It extends Redux's capabilities to handle asynchronous actions. Here's how it works:

Instead of dispatching a regular action directly, you can dispatch a function, which is a thunk. This function receives the dispatch and getState functions as
arguments.

Inside the thunk function, you can perform asynchronous operations like API calls or database queries.

You can then dispatch other actions within the thunk function, which can be either synchronous or asynchronous. These actions will change the state once the
asynchronous operations are complete.

5. Practical Use:

Let's say you want to fetch a list of user data from an API when a user clicks a button. You would create a thunk that looks like this:

// This is a Redux Thunk
const fetchUserData = () => {
  return async (dispatch, getState) => {
    // You can access the current state with getState()
    const currentState = getState();

    // You can dispatch regular (synchronous) actions
    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_DATA_REQUEST' });

    try {
      // Perform an asynchronous operation, e.g., fetch data from an API
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users');
      const data = await response.json();

      // Dispatch another action once the data is fetched
      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_DATA_SUCCESS', payload: data });
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle errors and dispatch an error action
      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_DATA_FAILURE', error: error.message });
    }
  };
};

With Redux Thunk, you can handle the entire asynchronous workflow within this thunk, dispatching actions to represent different stages of the operation (request,
success, failure).

6. Why Redux Thunk is Useful:

Redux Thunk is valuable because it allows you to maintain a predictable state management flow in your application, even when dealing with asynchronous operations.
It ensures that your UI stays in sync with your data, and it simplifies the handling of complex asynchronous workflows in a Redux application.
