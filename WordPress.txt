WordPress.com and WordPress.org are two different versions of WordPress.

WordPress.com is a hosting service that allows users to create a website using the WordPress platform. It is a fully managed service, which means that hosting, 
security, and backups are all handled by WordPress.com. Users can choose from a variety of pre-made templates and themes to design their site, and they can also use a 
limited set of plugins to add additional functionality. However, the level of customization is limited and users do not have access to the source code of their site.

WordPress.org, on the other hand, is the self-hosted version of WordPress. This means that users must provide their own hosting and manage their own backups and 
security. In return, they have full access to the source code of their site and can customize it as much as they want. This version also offers more control over the 
site, the ability to install any plugin, and use any theme they want.

In summary, WordPress.com is a simpler, more limited version of WordPress that is good for basic websites, while WordPress.org is a more powerful, flexible version 
that is better suited for more advanced websites.

documentation, to help users learn how to use the platform and troubleshoot issues.
