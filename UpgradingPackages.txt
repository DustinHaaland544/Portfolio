rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json  # Remove old dependencies, run this command in Git Bash instead of VS Code terminal
npm install -g npm-check-updates       # Install npm-check-updates tool
npx npm-check-updates -u               # Upgrade package.json to latest versions
npm install                            # Install the latest dependencies

After upgrading, run:
npm outdated

This will show if there are any outdated packages still remaining.

You can also check installed versions with:
