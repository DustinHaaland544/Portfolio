Tailwind provides to quickly style your HTML elements. This can save a lot of time and makes it easy to create consistent, professional-looking designs.

In great details, Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any 
annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override. It's a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style HTML elements using pre-defined classes. 
Each class applies a single utility, such as a font size, margin, padding, or color.

to quickly style elements of a webpage.

Tailwind also provides a set of pre-defined components, such as buttons, forms, and layout grids, that can be used to quickly create common UI elements. 
Additionally, you can easily customize the default values of any of the framework's settings to fit the design needs of your project.
