Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that manipulate that data.

In object-oriented programming, objects are used to represent real-world entities, such as a person or a bank account.

These objects contain data (called "attributes") and code (called "methods") that operate on that data.


One of the key features of object-oriented programming is inheritance, which allows objects to inherit characteristics and behavior from parent objects. 

This allows developers to create a "family tree" of objects, with more specialized objects inheriting characteristics from more general objects.


Other key features of object-oriented programming include encapsulation (hiding the implementation details of an object from other objects) and 

polymorphism (allowing objects of different types to be treated the same way).


Object-oriented programming is used in many programming languages, including Java, Python, C++, and C#.
