The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) suggests that 20% of the concepts in Redux will give you 80% of the value. 

Based on this, let's break down Redux learning into two phases:

The 20% Core Concepts (High Impact - Quick Mastery)

These are essential to start using Redux effectively.

The 80% Advanced Topics (Deepening Knowledge)

These help you optimize Redux usage but are not critical to start.

Phase 1: The 20% That Covers 80% of Redux

Goal: Learn Redux fast and start using it in a project.

Step 1: Understand the Core Redux Principles (1-2 hours)

What is Redux? → A state management library.

When to use it? → Best for managing complex global states.

Core Principles:

1. Single Source of Truth: One central store for state.

2. State is Read-Only: Use actions to update state.

3. Changes are Made with Pure Functions: Reducers modify state.

Step 2: Master the Redux Flow (Minimal Boilerplate Example) (3-4 hours)

Store: Central place to hold state.

Actions: Objects that describe state changes.

Reducers: Pure functions that modify state based on actions.

Dispatch: Sends actions to the store.

Selectors: Retrieve specific state from the store.

Code Example (Vanilla Redux, No React):

import { createStore } from 'redux';

// Action
const INCREMENT = "INCREMENT";
const increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT });

// Reducer
const counterReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Store
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));

store.dispatch(increment()); // { count: 1 }

Key Takeaways:

The store holds the state.

Actions describe changes.

Reducers update the state.

Dispatch triggers actions.

Step 3: Integrate Redux with React (Redux Toolkit Simplified) (3-5 hours)

Use Redux Toolkit (RTK) instead of manual Redux setup.

1. Install Redux Toolkit:

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

2. Create a Slice (Reducer + Actions in One File):

import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.count += 1; },
  },
});

export const { increment } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;

3. Configure Store:

import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { counter: counterReducer },
});

4. Use Redux in React Components:

import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { increment } from "./counterSlice";

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

Key Takeaways:

Redux Toolkit reduces boilerplate and simplifies state management.

useSelector() accesses state, useDispatch() triggers actions.

Slices combine actions and reducers.

Phase 2: The 80% That Makes You a Redux Pro

Goal: Optimize performance, handle async, and use Redux effectively.

Step 4: Learn Redux Async Handling (Redux Thunk vs RTK Query) (4-5 hours)

- Thunk Middleware: Handles async API calls.

- RTK Query (Recommended): Simplifies API data fetching.

Step 5: Debugging & Performance Optimization (2-3 hours)

Redux DevTools Extension for debugging.

Use Reselect for optimized state selection.

Normalize state using createEntityAdapter.
